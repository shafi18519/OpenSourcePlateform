# ArcReactor
ArcReactor is a free, open-source application used to collect OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) data
and send this data to a SIEM, such as ArcSight ESM or Splunk. This application is meant to be used by
security analysts and/or engineers who want to expand and compliment their event correlation, attack
prediction and overall threat insight by making use of open-source sources such as known bad host lists,
honeypot information, exploit and vulnerability trackers, and social media.

**Full documentation is available in the `docs` directory.**

## Import Update
This project is no longer maintained and has not been updated in many years.  
When it was originally created, there was a huge lack of these types of automated collection systems but now that gap has been filled by others who have done great work (_cough_ IntelMQ _cough_).  
I hope that in some small way this project, among others, started the path to the development of these newer and more robust OSINT collection systems. I want to thank everyone who has shown interest in this project over the years. Forks, stars, and watches are a big motivation to continue development on similiar projects, and open source development in general. 
  
Thank you! :)
